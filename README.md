## Hi there üëã
üë®‚Äçüî¨I am Dr. Deepak Verma, a Postdoctoral Fellow at Johns Hopkins Medicine, specializing in bioinformatics, cancer genomics, and translational microbiome research. With over eight years of experience in next-generation sequencing (NGS) and high-throughput data analysis, my research focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), through the integration of metagenomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic datasets.
My work spans multi-omics data integration, development of computational pipelines, and clinical applications, with active involvement in three major NIH-registered microbiome clinical trials (COIN, ANEW, and GAMMER). I bring expertise in tools such as QIIME2, Kraken2, MetaPhlAn4, HUMAnN3, RNA-Seq, scRNA-Seq, and methylation analysis, along with programming skills in R, Python, and Perl.
Throughout my academic journey, including my PhD at AIIMS, New Delhi, I have collaborated with clinicians and research teams across disciplines, contributed to high-impact publications, and helped establish genomics-based diagnostic workflows. I am passionate about advancing data-driven precision medicine through translational bioinformatics and open science.
